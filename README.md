# ClockworkLib
ClockworkLib is a small, yet easy to use and powerful library! It's mainly used in our newer and updated projects, but it can also be used freely by other devs!
It brings in cool and new useful features like : Screen Shake Implementation, Easier Way to add Sounds to Blocks, Voxel Shape Helper, Simple Config Example, SoundUtils and Tweaks, Easings, and much more!
